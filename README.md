# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-SMOTE


Download the Dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

In this ,  I have used the SMOTE(Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique) technique which is used when we have imbalanced dataset i.e unequal proportions of nominal variables or target variable generally in Classification problem. 

By using smote technique, we get equal proportions of the dataset and can easily get good classification score and accuracy .
